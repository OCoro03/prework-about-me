      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>A couple of my hobbies include reading a variety of books and playing video games. I like to stay up to date with the stock market as well as continue to build my portfolio. On the weekends I enjoy spending time with family and friends going on bike trips. </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is running my own start-up company.</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because it's a growing industry with "high demand and low supply". I want to be ahead of this very opportunistic field as every business today needs a website to identify themselves on the web and I believe I can capitalize on that. </p>
